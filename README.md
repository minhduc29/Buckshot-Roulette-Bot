# Buckshot Roulette Bot
#### _Project #7_
- A **_Discord_** bot that simulates the gameplay of the game **_Buckshot Roulette_** using **_discord.py_**

- The bot has 2 game modes, one with support items and one without support items

- The prefix of the bot is `!` and all commands have the same name as slash commands

- The bot is not intended to be hosted publicly online all the time. Instead, it is designed for personal use. This repository contains the implementation of how the bot works.

## How to use
- Create a file in the same directory named **_config.py_** to store your bot token and server id as follows:
```
TOKEN = "your bot token"
GUILD_ID = Your server id
```

- Run **_main.py_**
